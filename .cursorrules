# Design Prototype Playground (DPP)

You are helping build prototypes in Faire's Design Prototype Playground - a rapid prototyping environment for exploring product ideas outside the production monorepo.

## What This Is

The Design Prototype Playground is a lightweight, standalone React app where designers and collaborators rapidly prototype using similar-ish looking UI. It's NOT connected to production data or live experiments - it's a standalone environment for exploration and validation.

**Key Principles:**
- Near-production fidelity, not pixel-perfect
- Mock data is expected and encouraged
- Speed and clarity over polish
- Each prototype should be self-contained
- Demonstrate behavioral intent, not complete business logic

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router v7 for navigation
- No backend - all mock data

## Design System

**Typography:**
- Font: Inter (400, 500, 600)
- Headings: font-semibold or font-bold
- Use Nantes serif for hero/display text

**Colors:**
- Primary text: #333333
- Secondary text: #757575
- Borders: #dfe0e1
- Background: #f5f5f5
- White cards: #ffffff

**Spacing:**
- Max width: 1440px
- Page padding: 48px (px-12 in Tailwind)
- Section spacing: 48px or 32px

**Components:**
- Cards: bg-white, rounded-3xl, shadow-sm
- Buttons: rounded-lg, appropriate padding
- Use Tailwind utility classes

## Adding a New Prototype

When the user wants to create a new prototype, follow this workflow:

### 1. Ask for Context

**Ask the user:**
- "What's the prototype name?"
- "Is this for Brand or Retailer surface?"
- "Do you have a PRD or Notion doc I can read?"
- "What's the core interaction or flow you want to demonstrate?"

### 2. Read Existing Patterns

Before building, review these files:
- `src/config/prototypes.ts` - Metadata structure
- `src/pages/faire/BulkEditorPage.tsx` - Brand prototype example
- `src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx` - Retailer prototype example
- `src/App.tsx` - Routing patterns

### 3. Create Three Things

**A. Create the page file:**
- Location: `src/pages/[PrototypeName]Page.tsx`
- Use existing design patterns (fonts, colors, spacing)
- Include mock data inline or in separate file
- Keep it focused and self-contained

**B. Add the route** in `src/App.tsx`:
```tsx
<Route path="/[route-path]" element={<RouteWrapper><YourPrototypePage /></RouteWrapper>} />
```

**C. Register metadata** in `src/config/prototypes.ts`:
```tsx
{
  id: 'your-prototype-id',
  name: 'Your Prototype Name',
  path: '/your-route-path',
  description: '2-3 sentences about what this demonstrates',
  owner: 'John', // or whoever
  lastUpdated: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  surfaceArea: 'Brand', // or 'Retailer'
  category: 'experimental', // or 'template'
  status: 'wip', // or 'ready', 'active'
}
```

### 4. Important: Keep Prototypes Isolated

- Each prototype should be completely self-contained
- Don't modify other prototype files
- Don't change shared components unless necessary
- Use local state, don't affect global context
- Test that your prototype doesn't break others

### 5. Test

- Navigate to your prototype URL
- Verify it appears in the index gallery
- Check that all interactions work
- Ensure no errors in console

## URL Structure

The DPP uses URL-based navigation:
- `/` - Landing page (hero + intro)
- `/experimental` - Experimental prototypes gallery
- `/templates` - Template prototypes gallery
- `/components` - Component showcase
- `/[your-prototype]` - Individual prototype pages

## Fidelity Guidelines

**This prototype should:**
- ✅ Be visually close to production
- ✅ Demonstrate intended behavior and interactions
- ✅ Use mock data (hardcoded is fine)
- ✅ Focus on the core user experience
- ✅ Work as a clickable demo

**This prototype should NOT:**
- ❌ Be production-ready code
- ❌ Connect to real APIs or databases
- ❌ Have complete error handling
- ❌ Cover every edge case
- ❌ Be pixel-perfect

## When User Says "I want to build a new prototype"

1. **Acknowledge** you understand this is for the DPP
2. **Ask for PRD/Notion context** - "Do you have a PRD or design doc?"
3. **Ask for specifics** - surface area, key flows, interactions
4. **Read existing examples** - Learn from similar prototypes
5. **Build iteratively** - Start simple, add complexity
6. **Keep it isolated** - Don't touch other prototypes

## Quick Reference

**Prototype checklist:**
- [ ] Page file created in src/pages/
- [ ] Route added to src/App.tsx
- [ ] Metadata added to src/config/prototypes.ts
- [ ] Uses existing design patterns
- [ ] Mock data included
- [ ] Tested and working
- [ ] Shows up in index gallery
